# Contributing to React Storybook

Thanks for your interest in improving Storybook! We are a community-driven project and welcome contributions of all kinds: from discussion to documentation to bugfixes to feature improvements.

Please review this document to help to streamline the process and save everyone's precious time.

## Issues

No software is bug free. So, if you got an issue, follow these steps:

* Search the [issue list](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) for current and old issues.
* If non of that is helping, create an issue with with following information:
  * Clear title (make is shorter if possible).
  * Describe the issue in clear language.
  * Share error logs, screenshots and etc.
  * To speed up the issue fixing process, send us a sample repo with the issue you faced:

### Reproductions

The best way to help figure out an issue you are having is to produce a minimal reproduction. A good way to do that is using Create React App:

```bash
npm install --global create-react-app getstorybook

create-react-app reproduction
cd reproduction
getstorybook

# make changes to try and reproduce the problem, such as adding components + stories
npm start storybook

# see if you can see the problem, if so, commit it:
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "reproduction for issue #123"

# create an new repository on github to host the reproduction, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
git push -u origin master
```

If you follow that process, you can then link to the github repository in the issue. See https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues/708#issuecomment-290589886 for an example.

**NOTE**: If your issue involves a webpack config, create-react-app will prevent you from modifying the *app's* webpack config, however you can still modify storybook's to mirror your app's version of storybook. Alternatively, use `npm run eject` in the CRA app to get a modifiable webpack config.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

We welcome your contributions. There are many ways you can help us. This is few of those ways:

* Fix typos and add more documentation.
* Try to fix some [bugs](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/labels/bug).
* Work on [enhancements](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) and new [features](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature).
* Add more tests (specially for the UI).

Before you submit a new PR, make you to run `npm test`. Do not submit a PR if tests are failing. If you need any help, create an issue and ask.

### Reviewing PRs

**As a PR submitter**, you should reference the issue if there is one, include a short description of what you contributed and, if it is a code change, instructions for how to manually test out the change. This is informally enforced by our [PR template](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

**As a PR reviewer**, you should read through the changes and comment on any potential problems. If you see something cool, a kind word never hurts either! Additionally, you should follow the testing instructions and manually test the changes. If the instructions are missing, unclear, or overly complex, feel free to request better instructions from the submitter. Unless the PR is marked with the `do not merge tag`, if you approve the review and there is no other required discussion or changes, you should also go ahead and merge the PR.

## Issue Triage

If you are looking for a way to help the project, triaging issues is a great place to start. Here's how you can help:

### Responding to issues

Issues that are tagged `question / support` or `needs reproduction` are great places to help. If you can answer a question, it will help the asker as well as anyone searching. If an issue needs reproduction, you may be able to guide the reporter toward one, or even reproduce it yourself using [this technique](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reproductions).

### Triaging issues

Once you've helped out on a few issues, if you'd like triage access, you can help label issues, and respond to reporters. New issues should be labelled as one of `bug`, `new feature`, `question / support` or `discussion`.

If an issue is a `bug`, and it doesn't have a clear reproduction that you have personally confirmed, label it `needs reproduction` and ask the author to try and create a reproduction, or have a go yourself.

### Closing issues

- Duplicate issues should be closed with a link to the original.

- Unreproducible issues should be closed if it's not possible to reproduce them (if the reporter drops offline, it is reasonable to wait 2 weeks before closing).

- `bug`s should be closed when the issue is fixed and merged to `master`

- `new feature`s should be closed when merged or if the feature is deemed to be not appropriate.

- `question / support`s should be closed when the question has been answered. If the questioner drops offline, a reasonable period to wait is two weeks.

- `discussion`s should be closed at a maintainer's discretion.


## Development Guide

> If you want to work on a UI feature, refer to the [Storybook UI](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storybook-ui) project.

This project written in ES2016+ syntax so, we need to transpile it before use.
So run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will watch files and transpile.

### Linking

First of all link this repo with:

```sh
npm link
```

In order to test features you add, you may need to link the local copy of this repo.
For that we need a sample project. Let's create it.

```sh
npm install --global create-react-app getstorybook
create-react-app my-demo-app
cd my-demo-app
getstorybook
```

> It's pretty important to create a very simple sample project like above.
> Otherwise some of the functionality won't work because of linking.

Then link storybook inside the sample project with:

```sh
npm link @kadira/storybook
```

### Getting Changes

After you've done any change, you need to run the `npm run storybook` command every time to see those changes.
