## Getting Started

The `getstorybook` tool can be used to add Storybook to your React Native app. Install the `getstorybook` tool if necessary and run it from your project directory with these commands:

```shell
npm -g i getstorybook
getstorybook
```

## Start the Storybook

After initial setup start the storybook server with the storybook npm script.

```shell
npm run storybook
```

also start your mobile app with the `react-native` command.

```
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

Now, you can open <http://localhost:7007> to view your storybook.
